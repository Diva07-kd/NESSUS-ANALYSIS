## 🛡️ Features Covered

### ✅ Vulnerability Scanning

Nessus scans hosts and systems for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, weak settings, and exploitable services. Supported scan types include:

- Basic & Advanced Network Scans
- Web Application Tests
- Patch Audits
- Threat-specific scans (e.g., WannaCry, Zerologon, Solarigate)
- Malware Detection

### 📊 Risk Assessment

Each vulnerability is analyzed using industry-standard metrics. Severity levels are assigned to help prioritize response:

- 🔴 Critical  
- 🔶 High  
- 🟠 Medium  
- 🔵 Low  
- ⚪ Info  

### 📈 CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

Nessus uses **CVSS v3.0** to calculate a risk score (0–10) for each finding:

- **Base Score** – Intrinsic characteristics of the vulnerability  
- **Temporal Score** – Changes over time (e.g., exploit availability)  
- **Environmental Score** – Customized based on user environment

### 🛠️ Remediation

Each finding includes:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Affected services or ports
- Risk implications
- Recommended remediation steps (e.g., patching, disabling insecure protocols, enforcing authentication)

### 🔧 Security Tools Integration

Nessus is widely used alongside other tools like:

- SIEMs 
- Patch management platforms
- Asset discovery systems
- Cloud security tools

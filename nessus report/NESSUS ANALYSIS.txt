ANALYSIS OF NESSUS CONCEPT:

    Nessus is a tool used to find security problems in computer systems. It helps check if there are 
any vulnerabilities, 
missing patches, or weak settings that hackers could take advantage of. 
Nessus is often used by IT teams, ethical hackers, and security professionals to scan networks and systems.

    The main idea of Nessus is to scan devices, servers, or applications to see if they have any known 
issues. It checks for things like outdated software, weak passwords, open ports, or misconfigurations. 
It can also scan for malware and check compliance with certain rules or standards.

NESSUS INTERFACE EXPLANATION:

The Nessus interface is easy to use and has a lot of features. In the first image, you can see the main 
part of the interface where scan templates are shown. These templates let you choose what kind of scan 
you want to run. Some common ones include:

    1) Basic Network Scan – checks for general problems on any device.

    2) Advanced Scan – lets you configure everything manually.

    3) Malware Scan – checks for malware on Windows and Linux.

    4) Web Application Tests – scans websites for vulnerabilities.

    5) Credentialed Patch Audit – checks if important patches are missing.

There are also scans for specific threats like WannaCry ransomware, PrintNightmare, and Spectre/Meltdown.

On the left side, there's a menu where you can see your past scans, customize reports, and manage settings. 
It’s all organized so you can easily find what you need.
